Hypothetical thrusters
  NOTE : These are listed by name, regardless of practicality or possibility within reality.
  DATE : 2020-01-01
  TERM
    > Mach/Woodward Effect Thruster: Field propulsion spacecraft harnessing transient mass fluctuations in an object absorbing internal energy while undergoing proper acceleration. (Impossible!)
    > Impulse Engine: An engine causing acceleration through creating gravitational potential, not requiring a negative energy gradient, but not allowing relativistic speeds either. (Seems more possible than other things here.)
    > Wormhole traversal: Theoretically possible with exotic matter / negative energy gradient, also theoretically allows warp travel.
    > Alcubierre drive: Theoretical model of warp drive, requires more energy than a solar system(citation needed) and negative energy.
    > Helical Engine: Taking advantage of inertial mass changes in a stream of orbiting particles traveling at relativistic speeds to generate momentum without reaction mass in a closed system. (Impossible!)
    > Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster: Generates an anomalous thrust vector by pushing on a gyroscope. (Impossible, thoroughly studied.)
    > Dean drive: Some dude made a drive that actually works by friction, but was reported as a closed system reactionless drive.
    > Quantum vacuum thruster (QVT): Theoretical system like a plasma thruster, but operating on quantum vacuum fluctuations (aka the zero-point field) instead of a propellant.
    > Casimir drive: Hypothetical drive pushing off of the zero-point field.. Basically a QVT's alternate name.
    > Resonant cavity thruster: Akin to the EmDrive, supposedly produces net thrust through resonating an electromagnetic wave through a conical cavity. Closed system, impossible.
    > VSL drive: A drive that manipulates the speed of light locally to provide faster travel than otherwise possible. (I made this one up.)
    > Bimetric gravity drive: Made it up. Basically treating gravity as two metric tensors where the speed of light can become variable (hey whaddaya know, it's related to VSL)
    > FSD (Frameshift Drive): The FTL technology of the Elite universe, adjusts reference frames somehow allowing travel at many relativistic speeds.
    > Field propulsion drive: A class of drives based on pushing off of fundamental fields (i.e. Higgs field) instead of using propellant. These probably all violate physics.
    > Semi-inert drive: Fictional drive that partially eliminates inertia, allowing FTL travel. (Skipping infinite inertia buildup on approach to c, and skipping past the limit of c entirely.)
    > Chromodynamic drive: Made-up name for a drive, inspired by quantum chromodynamics, a real field of research / property of quantum mechanics. I don't remember which.
    > Belief/Mana/Soul drive: Fictional drive powered by thought, spirituality, or belief in its ability. Pure nonsense in reality, fun for writing perhaps.
    > Ion engine: I mean, these are real, but imagine a stupidly efficient overpowered one that isn't actually possible. :P
